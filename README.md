## Summary 
Statistics show that advanced surfers prefer the bigger waves in the months of December through February, the Surf Shop may be sustainable year round. However, the ice cream shop will need to take in some considerations. The months from November through April experiences the lowest average temperatures, perhaps too cold for ice cream. Ice cream is best enjoyed on a warm or hot day. We advise closing the ice cream shop from the month of November through April.
